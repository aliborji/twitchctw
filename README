CTW compressor. How long before we beat gzip

gzip: 3728 bytes <-- not easy to beat actually
xz:   3656 bytes


## comparing to existing CTW implementations

# https://github.com/cberzan/ctw.git ctw_baseline
This is the authors imp?
gets 3484, so CTW can do better than gzip

Though this code has tons of hacks, notably MAXCOUNTS
And I don't understand it's tree depth

# https://github.com/fumin/ctw.git
gets 4616, err, not good

# https://github.com/gkassel/pyaixi
CTW implementation seems numerically unstable...


Maybe this isn't as easy as I thought...
